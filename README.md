Unity Ashteroids
=============

A working port of [Richard Lord's Asteroids](http://github.com/richardlord/Asteroids) example game that uses his [Ash framework](https://github.com/richardlord/Ash). It uses [David Arno's .Net port](https://github.com/DavidArno/Ash.NET) of Ash for most of the heavy-lifting.

This project includes the [Unity Ash](https://github.com/mikecann/Unity-Ash) project as a SubModule.
